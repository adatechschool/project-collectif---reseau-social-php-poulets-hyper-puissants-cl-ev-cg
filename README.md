# PHP Social Network :
*Ada Tech School, two weeks group project.*
<hr>
Following pre-written code and instructions, we had to refactor repetitive code and implement new functions in a php social network, using PHP and a database for the first time.

A lot of minor problem-solving and grunt work, but also nice challenges near the end, even though the site is not completed as is.
